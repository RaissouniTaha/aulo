# Problem Statement for Government Agency Website Development

## Introduction
This project involves the development of a comprehensive website for a government agency, modeled after Morocco's Urban Agency website (AUT.gov.ma). The website will serve as the primary digital interface between the agency and the public, providing information, services, and resources related to the agency's mandate and operations.

## Problem Statement
The agency requires a modern, responsive, and user-friendly website that effectively communicates its mission, provides access to public services, and maintains transparency in its operations. Currently, the agency lacks a robust digital presence, which limits public engagement, reduces operational efficiency, and hinders the dissemination of important information to stakeholders.

## Objectives
1. Create a bilingual/multilingual website with intuitive navigation
2. Develop a responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices
3. Implement a comprehensive content management system for easy updates
4. Integrate interactive maps and spatial data visualization capabilities
5. Establish a secure document repository for regulations, forms, and publications
6. Provide platforms for public announcements and news
7. Enable contact mechanisms and service requests for citizens
8. Ensure accessibility compliance with government standards

## Deliverables
1. Fully functional website with all planned features and content sections
2. Content management system with user roles and permissions
3. Administrative documentation and training materials
4. User guides for content management and updates
5. Complete source code with documentation
